  ## A Lightweight and Practical CSS Utility Kit
  
  **Zero Config. Flat Learning Curve**  

  **Hgrid** is a starting point intended to make HTML work out of the box. It's built with Sass and integrates smoothly into any 
  Node.js driven project. It's not a UI framework, but provides some defaults so you can start prototyping without having to 
  deal with browser quirks, unstyled elements and basic responsiveness.

  Integrating **hgrid** in your projects is easy peasy and you'll very soon be doing the stuff you love (building things!).
