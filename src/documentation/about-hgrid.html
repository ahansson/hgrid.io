  <p class="intro">
    A lightweight, laptop-first CSS utility kit. The Swiss Army knife of CSS,
    with a mostly flat learning curve.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Hgrid</strong> is not a UI framework. It's a starting point, intended to make HTML work
    out of the box. It provides some defaults so you can start prototyping without having to 
    deal with browser quirks, unstyled elements and basic responsivity.</p>

  <h5>How lightweight?</h5>

  <h5>Why "laptop first"?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Because it's practical. Most web design is still done on a desktop
    or laptop screen. It's the center point between smaller and larger viewports. 
    It can be limiting to start building pages with styles that don't apply to all design elements by default. 
    It's practical to design and code for a laptop sized viewports and adjust for smaller and larger 
    screens along the way, unless you create exclusively for mobile devices. A mobile-first version of 
    <strong>hgrid</strong> is on the roadmap.
