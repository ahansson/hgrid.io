<p class="intro">
  A lightweight, laptop-first CSS utility kit. The Swiss Army knife of CSS,
  with a mostly flat learning curve.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Hgrid</strong> is a starting point intended to make HTML work
  out of the box. It's not a UI framework. It provides some defaults so you can 
  start prototyping without having to deal with browser quirks, unstyled elements and basic responsivity.
</p>

<h4 class="mt-50">Raison d'être</h4>

<p>
  Recent CSS/Sass/framework development has brought great technical progress to the the CSS world, but at a significant cost. 
  Setting everything up is often unnecessary complicated, with lots of configuration and involved learning. With <strong>hgrid</strong> 
  there's no configuration at all, unless you want and need it. Integrating it into your projects is 
  <a href="/documentation/integrate/">easy peasy</a> and you'll very soon be doing the stuff you love (building things!) instead of 
  figuring out how to get directives and plugin modules to work. 
</p>

<h4 class="mt-50">How lightweight?</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> The full, <a href="https://brotli.io/" target="_blank" title="Brotli Compression" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Brotli compressed</a> file weighs in at just 12.2 kB.
</p>

<h4 class="mt-50">Why "laptop first"?</h4>

<p>
  <strong>Answer:</strong> Because it's practical. Most web design is produced on a desktop
  or laptop screen. It's the center point between smaller and larger viewports. 
  It can be mentally limiting to start building pages with styles that don't apply to most of your design elements or 
  markup by default. It's practical to design and code for a laptop sized viewports and adjust for both smaller and larger 
  screens along the way, unless you create exclusively for mobile devices. A mobile-first version of 
  <strong>hgrid</strong> is on the roadmap.
