  <p class="intro">
    A lightweight, desktop-first CSS utility kit. The Swiss Army knife of CSS,
    with a mostly flat learning curve.
  </p>

  <h5>How lightweight?</h5>
  <p>
    Hgrid is not a UI framework, but a starting point intended to make HTML work
    out of the box, with very little effort. Ideal for fast prototyping without
    having to deal with browser quirks and unstyled elements. The gzipped file
    weighs in at 2 kb.
  </p>

  <h5>Why desktop first?</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Because most web design is still done on a desktop
    or laptop screen. It's limiting to start building pages with styles that
    don't apply to all viewports. It's more practical to start coding for
    desktop viewports and adjust for smaller and extra large screens along the
    way, unless you create exclusively for mobile devices.
